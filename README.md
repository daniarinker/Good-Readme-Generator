  ## Description:
  This project is a command line interface using inquirer and nodeJS to help coders spend less time writing ReadMe.md files for their projects and spend more time coding. This will initialize a prompt of questions for the user/coder to fill out. Then, it will generate a ReadME.md file for the user to use on their git repos and for projects they make.
  
  ## Installation:
  npm i
  
  ## Usage:
  Utilize this for all projects to help write a good ReadMe document.
